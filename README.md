# 🌱 Platformer game on Godot Part 1 🌱

* Platform game made on Godot v4.3 using 100% GDScript (Renderer: Compatibility)
* Followed Brackeys Yt Tutorial: - [Watch this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t=820s)

## 🌱 Assets 🌱:
On Brackey's YT video tutorial, you can find them on the description box.

### 🌱 Note:
I didn't change anything to the game and even the scripts. I just simply followed Brackey's video tutorial. 
I'm putting it here on github to serve as a backup in case my computer dies on me again. Notice that there's a "Part 1" above, that's because I'm planning to either expand this game for learning purposes, or to make this as a guide for creating my own platformer game, maybe with different assets or by making my own from scratch!
